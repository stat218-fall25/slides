# Course Description:

Life science is complicated. As your professor, I know you already know this, and it's not my intention to teach you that. However, I am committed to giving you a glimpse into some of these complexities by integrating statistical concepts into life science topics. By the end of this course, I hope to increase your awareness of the potential inaccuracies in any data you use which implies that there might not always be a single explanation or prediction for an event, but rather, a range of possible outcomes. In the best-case scenario, I will support you in making sense of uncertainty in the (1) behavior of chemicals, (2) relationships among living organisms & communities of living organisms, and (3) physical processes that sustain most of the living systems through the use of Statistics.

STAT 218 is tailored for life science students who will inevitably engage with Statistics in their future professions. 

In this course, we will cover the following concepts, illustrating real-world applications of Statistics in the life sciences: descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, parametric and nonparametric one-and two-sample hypothesis tests, analysis of variance, correlation, simple linear regression, chi-square tests. 

At times, we'll utilize the R programming language, a tool favored by _Homo sapiens_, to practically apply the techniques and theories learned. This includes making statistical inferences based on datasets.

## Student Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:

1. describe Statistics as a discipline in your own words,
2. explain the interactions between Statistics and life sciences,
3. design a data collection scheme based on simple random sampling or simple experimental designs,
4. distinguish between observational studies and experiments and understand the limitations (practical and consequential) of each,
5. summarize data using graphical techniques,
6. summarize data using numerical techniques,
7. construct and interpret confidence intervals for means and differences between means for independent samples,
8. construct and interpret confidence intervals for means and differences between means for paired samples,
9. conduct parametric two-sample hypothesis tests for means,
10. conduct non-parametric two-sample hypothesis tests for means,
11. construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single proportion,
12. conduct Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests and tests for independence,
13. distinguish between case-control and cohort studies and compute relative-risk and odds in the appropriate settings,
14. perform analysis of variance tests and post-hoc comparisons for completely randomized designs,
15. explain why correlation does not imply causation,
16. use simple linear regression to describe relationships between variables.

# Grading and Late Submission Policies

![](grading.png)


## Letter Grades 

Your final grades will be determined based on the total points earned. It's essential to review the letter grades outlined below for a clear understanding of the grading criteria. __Please be aware that I will not "round up" grades at the end of the quarter.__


| Letter grade  |Points|
|-------------- |----- |
| A             | $90 \le x$ |
| A^-^          | $87 \le x < 90$  |
| B^+^          | $84 \le x < 87$  |
| B             | $81 \le x < 84$  |
| B^-^          | $78 \le x < 81$  |
| C^+^          | $75 \le x < 78$ |
| C             | $72 \le x < 75$ |
| C^-^          | $69 \le x < 72$  |
| D^+^          | $66 \le x < 69$  |
| D             | $63 \le x < 66$  |
| D^-^          | $60 \le x < 63$ |
| F             | $x < 60$ |


# Assessment Types## 

Our weekly units/topics will follow a pattern and have been designed to give you practice with the concepts. Below you will find brief descriptions of the types of assignments in this course.


### Midterm and Final Exams

Exams are to be taken in-class without the use of your course notes/textbook/assignments/technological tools. It is expected that you will take exams as per the scheduled times. You may use a calculator. Here are the dates of exams:

__Thu, Oct 16:__ Midterm 1 Exam (In-class)

__Sat, Dec 06:__ Final Exam (TBD)

{{< pagebreak >}}

::: {.callout-important}

If you miss a key assessment (midterm or final exam) without contacting your instructor, your final letter grade will initially be recorded as **"Incomplete"**. 

An incomplete grade indicates that you have not finished all the required coursework. Please contact with me in advance if you miss any of these key assessments and complete the make-up exam to avoid your incomplete grade turning into an F.

If you fail to attend/upload multiple assessments listed in the Grading and Assessment section and rarely/never attend class, your final letter grade will be **"WU"**.


:::

### Project Presentation (Group)

The overarching goal of the project in this course is to empower students to become independent learners. This involves actively engaging with the learning process and taking ownership of your academic journey. You will have the opportunity to present a scientific article related to your major and include the following dimensions: (1) summarize the study, (2) identify its research question(s) and statistical procedures used, and (3) evaluate whether the study effectively communicated its findings. This approach not only enhances your understanding of how Statistics is utilized in your field but also fosters a proactive and self-directed approach to learning. Detailed rubric will be provided as a template on your Canvas page. 

__Thu, Nov 13:__ Project Presentation (will be uploaded online)

::: {.callout-important}

Your project grade is composed of following components:

__Project Slides:__ 40 points   
__Project Oral Presentation Video:__ 35 points   
__Project Peer Evaluation:__ 25 points  

:::


### Weekly Assignments (Individual)

We will have individual weekly assignments, __due Mondays at 11:59 PM__. These aim to serve two purposes: (1) Assessing your readiness level before beginning each week's material; or (2) Evaluating your understanding of the material covered in the preceding week. You will find them in Canvas. 

{{< pagebreak >}}

### Investigation & Lab Assignments (Group)

***Investigation Assignments***


There will be 8 investigation assignments, given every Tuesday, to be completed in this course. These assignments will focus on a key statistical concept. You are encouraged to work in groups of ***up to 3 people*** and submit one write-up with all group members’ names. ***If your partner is absent on a given day, feel free to join another group.*** All investigation assignments are due __Thursdays by 11:59 p.m.__

***Lab Assignments***

There will be 8 labs to complete in this course. Most labs should be finished during class time. Make sure to follow the lab write-up instructions carefully.

Lab sessions will be conducted in groups, and lab assignments will also be group assignments. Each group will consist of 2-3 students, who will work together to complete the labs both during and after class. ***If your partner is absent on a given day, feel free to join another group.*** All lab assignments are __due Sundays at 11:59 p.m.__


***Important:*** Please only include the names of group members who actively participated. If a group member is absent, they must either complete the assignment individually or coordinate with their group to finish it together. Feel free to shuffle groups if your partner is absent.


## Late Submission Policies

You have 3 “grace days” – days to turn in the assignment late without a penalty. These can be used __ONLY__ on weekly assignments (individual) and investigation assignments (a single group member must be willing to use one of their grace days for the entire group), but __NOT__ exams and in-class checkpoints. These “grace days” can be used all at once on a single assignment or used on separate assignments throughout the quarter. Simply add a comment on the assignment in Canvas BEFORE THE DEADLINE. After the expiration of your 'grace days', a 10% grade reduction will be applied for each day that the assignment is overdue. Late submissions __will not be accepted after one week__ from the original due date. __Resubmitting assignments is not allowed.__


### A Note on Attendance and Participation

Your attendance plays a crucial role in your ability to succeed in every type of assessment conducted in our class, as consistent absences may interrupt your learning and indirectly impact your grades. I will record attendance during every lecture, not for grading purposes, but track your learning progress in this class. In case of recurring absences, I will reach out to understand the reasons and work together to find solutions.

Your active involvement enriches our learning environment and enhances everyone's experience. Active involvement isn't about speaking up every day; it's about actively engaging with the material and activities. I respect that everyone learns differently. Whether you're comfortable sharing your thoughts in class or prefer a more reserved approach or seek clarification when needed, your participation is valued and will be recognized. 

In brief, you must be present in our classroom (both physically and mentally) unless you have an ["Excusable" Reason for Missing Class ](https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/class-attendance) and participate in classroom activities. Please contact with me in advance if you are not coming and do your best to catch up what we have done in that day. You can also come to my office hours or schedule a virtual appointment if you have questions about the missing class you had.


# Accessibility, Diversity and Inclusion

This course was designed to serve students from all diverse backgrounds, places, and perspectives. I view the diversity that participants bring to this classroom as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religion, country of origin, and culture. Please let me know if there are ways I can improve the effectiveness or experience of this class for you. In addition, if any of the assignment dates conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you.

I have taken numerous steps to ensure that all of the materials presented in this course are accessible to all participants, regardless of physical or learning disabilities. I know that everyone is unique, and I may have unintentionally overlooked something that limits access to some materials or activities. Please let me know if you cannot access any content. If you find you need additional accommodations to complete the required course work, please contact me via email [sdemirci@calpoly.edu](mailto:sdemirci@calpoly.edu) or come to my office! You can also contact the Disability Resource Center, Building 124, Room 119, at (805) 756-1395. 

[SensusAccess](https://lib.calpoly.edu/study-spaces-and-tech/convert/) is a self-service, alternate media solution made available by Kennedy Library to automatically convert files into a range of alternate media including audio books (MP3 and DAISY), e-books (EPUB, EPUB3 and Mobi) and digital Braille. The service can also be used to convert inaccessible files such as image-only PDF files, JPG pictures and Microsoft PowerPoint presentations into more accessible and less tricky formats. This service is available at no charge for all Cal Poly students, faculty, staff and alumni. Also, starting Summer 2021, alternative formats within Canvas have been enabled with Ally. [Learn more about Ally's alternative formats.](https://canvassupport.calpoly.edu/ally-students)

## Disability Accomodations

This course was developed with accessibility in mind; however, if you require accommodations or assistance of any kind, or cannot access materials in the course, or complete an assignment due to a disability, please contact me via email [sdemirci@calpoly.edu](mailto:sdemirci@calpoly.edu) or come to my office as soon as you can, so I can assist you promptly. If you wish to request disability-related accommodations for this or any other course, please contact the [Disability Resource Center](https://drc.calpoly.edu/content/drc-services). It's important to do this with as much advanced notice as possible, so you have full access to your course materials and activities in a timely manner.

## Academic Honesty

Learning thrives in an environment built on trust and respect. The subsequent actions undermine academic integrity, creating obstacles to effective learning:

- Allocating less time than necessary for a satisfactory job.
- Skipping readings or neglecting non-graded activities.
- clicking through course information without thoroughly reviewing resources.

While these behaviors can impact your grade and learning experience, they are personal choices. On the other hand, certain actions go beyond mere 'choices' and breach academic regulations and even legal boundaries. These include:

- Plagiarizing text by directly copying from websites, blogs, other discussions, or published texts.
- Recycling an essay or project previously submitted for another class.
- Engaging in dishonest practices during a test or project.
- Copying directly from another student or source (including AI tools) without proper attribution.
- Purchasing or replicating an essay or project from an online source.

It's crucial to familiarize yourself with the Cal Poly definitions of [Cheating and Plagiarism](https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating). Take a moment to read this page and understand these concepts. If you're uncertain about citing a source, incorporating a quote, or acknowledging someone in your summaries, I'm here!

On the downside, the college doesn't differentiate between breaking rules intentionally or unintentionally—the consequences remain consistent. In my class, the first instance of misquoting, misrepresentation, or copy/pasting requires a redo of the work and a one-on-one meeting with me. Upon a second occurrence, we meet again, but you won't be allowed to redo the assignment, receiving a zero for that grade. For a third instance, you will not pass the class. Let's take a proactive approach! If you're unsure about citing, don't hesitate to ask!

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools Usage Policy

Generative AI tools, which create text, images, code, audio, and other content, are widely available. However, AI tools should not be seen to avoid learning the material, but rather as a tool that can help you master content and produce better results. Keep your academic integrity intact and make sure your own ideas shine through. Always cite AI contributions to maintain academic integrity. AI is allowed for ***certain assignments*** as specified below. ***Otherwise, do not use AI tools.*** If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they may (1) be trained on outdated, biased, or copyrighted materials and/or (2) result in plagiarism, copyright issues, or inaccuracies. Therefore, you are responsible for ensuring the quality and accuracy of your work, not the AI. When permitted, generative AI use must be properly documented and credited according to APA style. For example:

* OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. https://chat.openai.com/chat

**Advice:** (1) Good prompts lead to better AI results & (2) Always verify AI-generated facts. 

More importantly, relying on AI without applying your own critical thinking undermines the value of your college education. Use AI tools responsibly — your judgment and expertise are what distinguish you as a learner and future professional.


### Assignment Guidelines

***Weekly Assignments (Individual):*** AI use is prohibited.

***Midterm and Final Exams:*** AI use is prohibited.

***Project Presentations:*** You may use AI to understand articles, but your presentation must be original. Attach any AI conversations to your project.

***Lab Assignments:*** You may use AI for coding, but only after attempting the task yourself. Understanding the computer language is essential in this course and you will primarily adjust provided code rather than write from scratch. Attach any AI conversations to your submission.

***Investigation Assignments:*** AI usage is prohibited. I’ll be in the classroom and available in my office hours to answer your questions.

Unauthorized use of AI for assignments will be considered a violation of the course's academic integrity policy, and appropriate actions will be taken in accordance with Cal Poly's Academic Dishonesty policy.
