## Introduction
::: {style="font-size: 32px"}

- So far, we have interested in the analysis of a single sample of a numeric variable.
  - In practice, most of the scientific research involves the comparison of 2 or more samples from different populations.
- If the observed variable is quantitative, the comparison of two samples can include
  (1) comparison of means,
  (2) comparison of standard deviations
  (3) comparison of shapes.

- In this week, we will be dealing with the comparison of 2 means

## 
### Notation
::: {style="font-size: 26px"}

- We employed a parallel notations but to be able to differentiate two samples from each other, we will use __subscript__.

![Figure 1. Naturally Occurring Populations](img/notation.png){fig-align="center"}

- The two populations that we are interested in can be either
  - naturally occurring populations (Figure 1) OR
  - conceptual populations defined by certain experimental conditions.

# Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Interval for ($\mu_1$ - $\mu_2$)


## 
### An Example

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 24px"}
The Wisconsin Fast Plant, _Brassica campestris_, has a very rapid growth cycle that makes it particularly well suited for the study of factors that affect plant growth. 

In one such study, 7 plants were treated with the substance Ancymidol (ancy) and were compared to 8 control plants that were given ordinary water. Heights of all of the plants were measured, in cm, after 14 days of growth.

__($df$ for this question is calculated as 12).__ 

Let's see an example for hypothesis testing.

##
### The Null and Alternative Hypotheses
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

The hypothesis that $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are not equal is called an __alternative hypothesis__ (or a research hypothesis)

$$
H_A: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2
$$


Its antithesis is the __null hypothesis__,
$$
H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2
$$

which asserts that $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are equal. A researcher would usually express these
hypotheses more informally and we can trace those hypotheses from the examples, problems and exercises in this course.

::: fragment
Alternatively we can express these hypotheses as following:

$$
\\H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0
\\H_A: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0
$$
:::
:::

## 
### Confidence Interval for ($\mu_1$ - $\mu_2$)
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

Remember our CI formula when we had one single quantitative variable.
$$
\\95 \% \ CI = (\bar{y} \pm \ multiplier \ \times \ SE_{\bar{y}})
$$

<br>

Let's revise our 95% confidence interval formula for comparing two means.

::: fragment

$$
\\95 \% \ CI = (\bar{y_1}-\bar{y_2}) \pm \ multiplier \times SE_{\bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_2} 
$$
:::

:::

## 
### What is Standard Error

::: {style="font-size: 24px"}

::: fragment
The formula that we have used so far is

$$
SE_{\bar{Y}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
:::

- Naturally, we can say that taking the difference between two sample means is an estimate of the quantity ($\mu_1$ - $\mu_2$).

- However, the formula for the standard error of the difference ($\bar{Y}_1$ - $\bar{Y}_2$) is a little different from what we initially thought.

::: fragment

$$
SE_{\bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_2} = \sqrt{SE_1^2 + SE_2^2}
$$
:::

::: fragment

$$
SE_{\bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_2} = \sqrt{ \frac {s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac {s_2^2}{n_2}}
$$

:::

::: fragment
$$
SE_{\bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_2} = \sqrt{ \frac {4.8^2}{8} + \frac {4.7^2}{7}} = 2.46
$$
:::
:::

## Confidence Interval for ($\mu_1$ - $\mu_2$)

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

multiplier is 2.164 for this question.

::: fragment

$$
\\95 \% \ CI = (\bar{y_1}-\bar{y_2}) \pm \ multiplier \times SE_{\bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_2} 
$$
:::

::: fragment
$$
\\95 \% \ CI = (15.9 - 11) \pm \ 2.164 \times 2.46 
\\ 4.9 \pm 5.32
$$
:::

- In our hypothetical example, we calculated 95% CI and we found it as (-0.42,10.22)

  - We are 95% confident that the population average 14-day height of fast plants
when water is used ($\mu_1$) is between 0.4 cm lower and 10.2 cm higher than the average
:::

##
#### Calculate test statistic
::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

<br>

- Test statistic is a measure of how far the difference between the sample means ($\bar{y}$’s) is from the difference we would expect to see if $H_0$ were true (zero difference), __the amount of variation we expect to see__ in differences of means from random samples. 

:::fragment

$$
test \ statistic = \frac{(\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{SE(\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2)}
$$
:::

:::fragment

$$
\frac{(15.9 - 11.0) - (0)}{2.46} = 1.99
$$

### Draw Conclusion 

<br>

::: fragment

__Conclusion:__ We fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data do not provide strong evidence that Ancymidol suppresses plant growth.

:::


## But...
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
- Ancymidol is known as a plant growth regulator that reduces plant growth by inhibiting gibberellin biosynthesis. 

- In our hypothetical example, we calculated 95% CI and we found it as (-0.4,10.2)

  - We are 95% confident that the population average 14-day height of fast plants
when water is used ($\mu_1$) is between 0.4 cm lower and 10.2 cm higher than the average
14-day height of fast plants when [Ancymidol](https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/reregistration/fs_PC-108601_1-Jun-95.pdf) is used ($\mu_2$).

# Decision Errors


##
### Type II Error ($\beta$) 

::: {style="font-size: 32px"}

:::{.callout-note title="Definition"}

$\beta$ = Pr{lack of significant evidence for $H_A$} if $H_A$ is true

OR

failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is actually true.

:::

- If $H_A$ is true, but we do not observe sufficient evidence to support $H_A$, then we
have made a Type II error.

  - We might have committed to Type II Error in Ancymidol example.

:::

##
### Type I Error ($\alpha$)
::: {style="font-size: 20px"}

:::{.callout-note title="Definition"}
$\alpha$ = Pr{finding significant evidence for $H_A$} if $H_0$ is true

OR

rejecting the null hypothesis when $H_0$ is actually true.
:::

::: fragment
::: {.incremental}
- Claiming that data provide evidence that significantly supports $H_A$ when $H_0$ is true
is called a Type I error. 
- In choosing ($\alpha$), we are choosing our level of protection against Type I error. 
  - Many researchers regard 5% as an acceptably small risk. 
    - If we do not regard 5% as small enough, we might choose to use a more conservative value of a
such as a = 0.01; in this case the percentage of true null hypotheses that we reject would be not 5% but 1%.
- In practice, the choice of a may depend on the context of the particular experiment.
  - A regulatory agency might demand more exacting proof of efficacy for a toxic drug than for a relatively innocuous one. 
- Also, a person’s choice of ($\alpha$) may be influenced by his or her prior opinion about the phenomenon under study.
  - Suppose an agronomist is skeptical of claims for a certain soil treatment; in evaluating a new study of the treatment, he might express his skepticism by choosing a very conservative significance level (say, ($\alpha$) = 0.001), thus indicating that it would take a lot of evidence to convince him that the treatment is effective. 
  - For this reason, written reports of an investigation should include a $P$-value so that each
reader is free to choose his or her own value of a in evaluating the reported results.

## Type I Error vs Type II Error

- Table 7.3.2 displays the situations in which Type I and Type II errors can occur. 

![](img/type-1-2-table.png){width=50% fig-align="center"}
 
  - For example, if we find significant evidence for $H_A$, then we eliminate the possibility of a Type II error, but by rejecting $H_0$ we may have made a Type I error.
