# An Important Update for 09:10 AM Class

## Class Location Update!

<br>
<br>

Our classes will be held in ___Building 010-0222___ starting on __Tuesday, September 23.__


## Today's Outline 


- Late Submission Policy

- Extra Credit

- Lab 0 Instructions

- Data, Observational unit, Variable 

- Types of Evidence



## 
### Late Submission Policy

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

I do not want class deadlines to cause you extreme stress or anxiety. 

- I offer 3 “grace days” – days to turn in the assignment late without a penalty."

- These can be used __ONLY__ on weekly assignments, lab assignments and investigation assignments (a single group member must be willing to use one of their grace days for the entire group), but __NOT__ exams or the midterm group project. 

- These “grace days” can be used all at once on a single assignment or used on separate assignments throughout the quarter. Simply add a comment on the assignment in Canvas BEFORE THE DEADLINE.

- After the expiration of your 'grace days,' a 10% grade reduction will be applied for each day that the assignment is overdue. 

- Late submissions __will not be accepted after one week__ from the original due date. 

- __Resubmitting assignments is not allowed.__

:::


##
### Extra Credits - Week 1

<br>
<br>

- 3 short extra credit opportunities - See Canvas 
  - Participant Informed Consent 
  - Curiosity Pre-test 
  - I wonder #1




# Installing R for STAT 218

##
### Install R and RStudio
::: {style="font-size: 32px"}


- __Install R:__ Yes, you do need to download and install R even if you have downloaded before. There is a newer version and it is free.

  - <a href = "https://cran.rstudio.com/" target = blank>{{< fa link >}}</a> Link to install R.

- __Install RStudio:__ Yes, you do need to download and install RStudio even if you have downloaded before. There is a newer version. Download the free Desktop version.

  - <a href = "https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" target = blank>{{< fa link >}}</a> Link to install RStudio Desktop.

- After installation, try the following test and contact if you need help.

## 
### Is my RStudio working?

::: {style="font-size: 24px"}

{{< video video/test-r.mp4>}}

:::

##
### If it is not working...

- In very rare situations, it is not working.

- OR you want to bring your iPad instead of your laptop.

- In these cases, please use the online version of R Studio (again, it is free but you have to sign up with your email address)

# This Week's Glossary


##

### Glossary

::: {style="font-size: 32px"}
The main terms that we will learn today:

- Data   
- Data Frame  
- Observational Unit (case, study subject)   
- Variable  
   - Categorical 
      - Binary (if it has 2 sub-groups)  
   - Quantitative  
- Anectodal Evidence vs. Empirical Evidence  
- Observational Study & Experimental Study   
- ...
:::



## Data

<br>
<br>

Recorded values, whether numbers or labels, together with their context are called __data__. 


## Data Sources

Data can be obtained:

- Through research
  - Experiments (with variable manipulation)
  - Observational studies (without manipulation)
  - …

- From information collected by public or private agencies

- From online sources (e.g., websites, databases)



## Data Frame

<br>

- All data have a __context__. 

- Data are often organized into a data table or data matrix. See the next slide.


## Data Frame/Matrix

![](img/3.png){fig-align="center"}

## Observational Unit    

<br>
<br>

- The person or thing being measured.
- Case, study subject, experimental unit are other names for it.


## Variable  

<br>
<br>

- Any characteristic of a person or thing that can be assigned a number or category.

## Categorical Variable

- When a variable names categories and answers questions about how cases fall into those categories, it is called a __categorical variable__.

  - e.g., eye color (green, blue, brown) 
    
- may only have two possible values (like “yes” or “no”).
  - We call them binary variables.

- may be a number like a __zip code__.
 
  
## Quantitative Variable


<br>

- When a variable has measured numerical values with units and the variable tells us about the quantity of what is measured, it is called a __quantitative variable__.

- e.g., temperature (F or C), speed (mph)...




## Data Frame/Matrix Revisited

## But...

<br>
<br>

Data alone can’t make good decisions. We need a solid approach.


# Types of Evidence


## Anectodal Evidence
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}


- An __anecdote__ is a concise story or illustration of a captivating event. 
  - E.g., A man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish, so the average mercury concentration in swordfish must be dangerously high.

<br>

::: {.callout-important}

- Be cautious when handling data collected in a haphazard manner.

- While such evidence may be authentic and verifiable, it often represents exceptional cases rather than forming a reliable basis for general conclusions.

:::
:::

## Empirical Evidence

<br>
<br>

- We need empirical evidence to make decisions in science.

- Statistical studies help us design research collect, organize, summarize, visualize and analyze data.

## Observational Studies

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}


- In an observational study, the researcher systematically collects data from subjects as an observer, __without manipulating conditions.__

::: {.callout-important}


- **The Presence Confounding Variables:** Observational studies may lead to misinterpretations due to the presence of confounding variables.

- The context in which data collected is crucial in statistics. It alerts us to potential effects of other factors.

- __Data analysis without reference to context is considered meaningless.__

## Experimental Studies

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

__Sinusitis and Antibiotics.__ Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day period, patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms.




:::

## Experimental Studies

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

The design of this experiment allows for the investigation of the interaction between two factors:

- self-reported improvement in symptoms and group type (experimental/placebo). 

- In this scenario, researchers applied the conditions—specifically, different group types to the subjects, which were _Homo sapiens_.

- By **randomly assigning** treatments to the subjects, we can address the issue of confounding that complicates observational studies, thereby expanding the scope of conclusions we can draw from the research.

- **Randomized Experiments as the Pinnacle in Scientific Inquiry:** Randomized experiments are often regarded as the pinnacle in scientific investigation due to their ability to overcome confounding.  
  - However, it's crucial to acknowledge that they are not without their own set of challenges.
:::

## Experimental Studies

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

Randomized experiments are generally built on four principles.

1. Controlling  
2. Randomization  
3. Replication   
4. Blocking

## 
### Reducing Bias in Experimental Studies

We can reduce bias in experimental studies by employing:

- Treatment/Control Group  
  - Placebo Group   
  - Blinding / Double Blinding

## Placebo
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- Placebos are commonly administered to human subjects in experiments, often in the form of an inert substance like a sugar pill.
  
- The well-documented placebo response illustrates that individuals frequently exhibit positive reactions to any treatment, even when it lacks active ingredients.

- In many cases, a placebo leads to a subtle yet genuine improvement in patients, a phenomenon known as the _placebo effect._

  - However, when implementing a placebo control, it is crucial for subjects to remain unaware of their group assignment—whether they are receiving the active treatment or the inert placebo.
  
:::


## Blinding/Double-Blinding

<br>


- If researchers keep patients unaware of their treatment, the study is termed __blind__.

- When both researchers and patients remain unaware of the individuals in the treatment groups, it is referred to as __double-blind__.
