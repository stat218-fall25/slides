# Inference for Means

##
### Important Symbols

To distinguish a quantitative variable from a categorical variable, we use different symbols to show population parameters and sample statistics.

__Parameters__

$\mu$ = population mean

$\sigma$ = population standard deviation

__Statistics__

$\bar{x}$ = sample mean

$s$ = sample standard deviation


## 
### College Midwest - Example

- Let’s consider a situation (again) where we actually have access to the entire population.
- We recently obtained data on the student body of a small college in the Midwest. 
  - There are 2,919 students in this population.
  - We will take a random sample of 30 students.

__Observational Unit__: A student in that college.
__Variable__: Cumulative GPA
__Statistic__: Sample Mean

## 
### College Midwest - Example

- Each simple random sample gave us a different value for the sample mean. 
Taking 1,000 random samples helps us see the long-run pattern to these statistics. 
  - In other words, we are approximating the sampling distribution of the sample means.

- Let's see the [applet](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/sampling/OneSample.html) to conduct a hypothesis testing

# Confidence Interval for µ

##
### Introduction

* In previous chapters, we were focusing on inferences about a population proportion (categorical variable).   
* Now, we will focus on data consisting of __a single quantitative variable__.  

* We will make inferences about a population mean (this is our new parameter now) by creating confidence intervals. 





## 
### Confidence Interval Formula - Revisited


The general form of a confidence interval is

$$ 
\\ statistic \pm multiplier \times (SD \ of \ statistic)
$$

Here, our statistic will be the sample mean and multiplier will come from _t_-distribution.

$$ 
\\ \bar{x} \pm t^* \times (s/ \sqrt{n})
$$


# Student's _t_ distribution 

## What is _t_ distribution?
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- $t$-distribution is another bell shape and symmetric distribution that can be useful if we do not know anything about population parameters.

- The $t$-distribution is always centered at zero and has a single parameter: __degrees of freedom__.
  - The shape of the distribution depends on the degrees of freedom.

- Broadly speaking, we use $t$-distribution with $df = n − 1$
  - to model the sample mean when the sample size is $n$.
  - As the $df$ is increasing, the $t$-distribution will look more like __the standard normal distribution__ 
    - when the $df$ is about 30 or more, the $t$
-distribution is nearly indistinguishable from the normal distribution.

### Comparison of _t_ and the Standard Normal Distribution

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- Both are symmetric and bell-shaped but $t$-distribution has a larger standard deviation.

- The $t$-distribution has a single parameter: __degrees of freedom__.
- Standard Normal Distribution has two parameters: __$\mu$__ and __$\sigma$__.

Suppose we consider these 14 observations as a random sample from a population.

##
### Confidence Interval - Verbal Explanation
::: {style="font-size: 32px"}

And...

::: fragment

- If we calculate confidence intervals for each of these 100 samples, we will find that around 95% of these intervals capture the true population mean. 

- We are 95% confident that the true population mean is in this confidence interval.

# Planning a Study to Estimate μ

## Planning a Study to Estimate μ
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- Before collecting data for a research study, it is wise to consider in advance whether
the estimates generated from the data will be sufficiently precise. 
  - It can be painful indeed to discover after a long and expensive study that the standard errors are so large that the primary questions addressed by the study cannot be answered.

- The precision with which a population mean can be estimated is determined by
two factors: 
(1) the population variability of the observed variable Y, and 
(2) the sample size.

:::

## Planning a Study to Estimate μ

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- In some situations the variability of Y cannot, and perhaps should not, be reduced. 
  - For example, a wildlife ecologist may wish to conduct a field study of a natural population of fish; the heterogeneity of the population is not controllable and in fact is a proper subject of investigation.

- On the other hand, it is often appropriate, especially in comparative studies, to
reduce the variability of Y by holding extraneous conditions as constant as possible.
  - For example, physiological measurements may be taken at a fixed time of day; tissue
may be held at a controlled temperature; all animals used in an experiment may be the same age

## What sample size will be needed?

Recall that 

::: fragment
$$
SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
:::

We can use this formula to determine our sample size as follows:

:::fragment
$$
Desired \ SE = \frac{Guessed \ SD}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
:::
## 
### Monarch Butterfly - Example

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 24px"}


Suppose the researcher is now planning a new study of butterflies Monarch butterflies at Oceano Dunes State Park in California and has decided that it would be desirable that the SE be no more than $0.4 \ cm^2$


- $\bar{y} = 32.8143 \ cm^2$  and $s= 2.4757 \ cm^2$

::: fragment
$$
SE_{\bar{y}} = s / \sqrt{n}
$$
:::

:::fragment
$$
Desired \ SE = Guessed \ SD / \sqrt{n}
$$
:::

:::fragment
$$
\\Desired \ SE = 2.48 / \sqrt{n} \ \le 0.4
\\ n\ge 38.4 
$$
$$
\\ at \ least \ 39 \ butterflies
$$

- You may wonder how a researcher would arrive at a value such as  $0.4 \ cm^2$ for the
desired SE. Such a value is determined by considering how much error one is willing
to tolerate in the estimate of μ.
