## Warning!

::: {style="font-size: 30px"}


In this lecture, I will again introduce more concepts in data visualization AND the anatomy of `ggplot()` function.

<br>

Please DO NOT CODE with me, just watch the demo to understand the basics.

<br>

After that, you will have a chance to try out some of these codes with your group members.

<br>

I will use a dataset in my slides but you are going to use another data set in your lab assignment.

:::


```{r message = FALSE}
#| echo: false
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
data(babies)
babies <- babies %>% 
  mutate(smoke = as.logical(smoke),
         parity = as.logical(parity))
```


## Data Visualizations
::: {style="font-size: 36px"}

- are graphical representations of data

- use different colors, shapes, and the coordinate system to summarize data

- can tell a story or can be useful for exploring data

# Visualizing a Single Categorical Variable

## If you...


::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

<br>

- If you could speak to R in English, how would you tell R to make this plot for you?

OR

- If you had the data and had to draw this bar plot by hand, what would you do?

:::
:::



::: {.column width="50%"}

<br>

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = smoke)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
:::
:::


## Maybe...

<br>
- We could tell R something like...

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 24px"}
- Consider the data frame
- Count number of mothers in each `smoke`
- Put `smoke` on x-axis.
- Put `count` on y-axis.
- Draw the bars.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = smoke)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

:::
:::

## 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 24px"}

<br>
<br>

These ideas are all correct but some are not necessary in R

- Consider the data frame
- ~~Count number of mothers in each `smoke`~~
- Put `smoke` on x-axis.
- ~~Put `count` on y-axis~~.
- Draw the bars.

R will do some of these steps by default.

### Let's Take a Look at the Babies Data Set

::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

Let's use our `library()`, `data()`, and `glimpse()`function to start.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)
data(babies)
glimpse(babies)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
babies <- babies %>% 
  mutate(smoke = as.logical(smoke),
         parity = as.logical(parity))
```


:::

##
### Let's Take a Look the Babies Data Set

::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

We need to learn the variables before proceeding.
```{r}
# ?babies
```

`case`: id number

`bwt`: birth weight, in ounces

`gestation`: length of gestation, in days

`parity`: binary indicator for a first pregnancy (0 = first pregnancy)

`age`: mother's age in years

`height`: mother's height in inches

`weight`: mother's weight in pounds

`smoke`: binary indicator for whether the mother smokes

##
### 3 Steps of Making a Basic ggplot()

<br>

1. Pick data

2. Map data onto aesthetics

3. Add the geometric layer


##
### Bar plot - Step 1 - Pick Data

Let's use `smoke` variable within `babies` dataset which is a categorical variable indicating whether the mother smokes or not.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies)
```


##
### Bar plot - Step 2 - Map Data to Aesthetics

Let's use `smoke` variable within `babies`dataset which is a categorical variable indicating whether the mother smokes or not.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = smoke)) 
```


##
### Bar plot - Step 3 - Add the Geometric Layer

Let's use `smoke` variable within `babies`dataset which is a categorical variable indicating whether the mother smokes or not.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies, 
       aes(x = smoke)) +
  geom_bar()
```


##
::: {.panel-tabset group="binwidth" style="font-size: 80%"}


## Bar plot

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggplot(data = babies, 
       aes(x = smoke)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## English

<br>
<br>

- Create a `ggplot` using the `babies` data frame.
- Map the `smoke` to the x-axis.
- Add a layer of a bar plot.


## R

<br>
<br>

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
ggplot(data = babies, 
       aes(x = smoke)) +
  geom_bar()
```

# Visualizing a Single Numeric Variable

## Histogram

Let's use `bwt` variable which is a numeric variable indicating birth weight in ounces

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = bwt)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## Histogram

Let's use `bwt` variable which is a numeric variable indicating birth weight in ounces


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = bwt)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15)
```



## A Colorful Histogram

Let's use `bwt` variable which is a numeric variable indicating birth weight in ounces

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = bwt)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, 
                 fill = "seagreen2")
```


## A Colorful Histogram

Let's use `bwt` variable which is a numeric variable indicating birth weight in ounces

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = bwt)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, 
                 color = "white", 
                 fill = "maroon")
```
Choose your own [color](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/R-colours-a4.pdf)

##

::: {.panel-tabset group="binwidth" style="font-size: 80%"}

## English

- Create a ggplot using the babies data frame.
- Map the `bwt` to the x-axis.
- Add a layer of a histogram.
- Change the binwidth to 15.
- Color the borders of the bars (bins?) as white.
- Fill it with a color code named maroon

## R Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = bwt)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, 
                 color = "white", 
                 fill = "maroon")
```

## Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = bwt)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, 
                 color = "white", 
                 fill = "maroon")
```

:::


## 

::: {.panel-tabset group="binwidth" style="font-size: 80%"}

## Binwidth = 0.5

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(babies, aes(x = bwt)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)
```

## Binwidth = 3

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(babies, aes(x = bwt)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3)
```

## Binwidth = 10

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(babies, aes(x = bwt)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```


## Binwidth = 15

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(babies, aes(x = bwt)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15)
```

# Visualizing One Categorical and One Numeric Variable


## Boxplot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = na.omit(babies),
       aes(x = smoke,
           y = bwt))  +
  geom_boxplot()

```

We are visualizing a single numerical and single categorical variable by using `geom_boxplot`


## Anatomy of A Boxplot

![](img/boxplot.png)

# Visualizing Two Numerical Variables 

## Scatterplot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = gestation,
           y = bwt))  +
  geom_point()
```


# Visualizing More Than Two Variables

## Let's Try This

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column

ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = gestation,
           y = bwt,
           color = smoke)) +
  geom_point()
```
We colored continuous variables by `smoke`


## And Then...

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = gestation,
           y = bwt,
           shape = smoke)) +
  geom_point()
```

We put different shapes for continuous variables by `smoke`.


## And Then...

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column

ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = gestation,
           y = bwt,
           shape = smoke,
           color = smoke)) +
  geom_point()
```

Now, we apply both different shapes and different colors.


## More on ggplot 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = gestation,
           y = bwt,
           shape = smoke,
           color = smoke)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  labs(x = "Length of Gestation (days)",
       y = "Birth Weight",
       title = "Babies")
```

Let's use `labs()` function to increase its readability.


## And then...

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column

ggplot(data = babies,
       aes(x = gestation,
           y = bwt,
           shape = smoke,
           color = smoke)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  labs(x = "Length of Gestation (days)",
       y = "Birth Weight",
       title = "Babies") +
  theme_bw()
```
We added another layer called `theme_bw()`. This function is about the background, the size of the text etc.


## And then...


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column

ggplot(data = na.omit(babies),
       aes(x = gestation,
           y = bwt,
           shape = smoke,
           color = smoke)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  labs(x = "Length of Gestation (days)",
       y = "Birth Weight",
       title = "Babies") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=18))
```
Now, we elaborated this function a little bit more and omit the NA values.
