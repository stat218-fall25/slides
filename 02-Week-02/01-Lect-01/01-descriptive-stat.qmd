## 
### Let's Refresh Our Memory

::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

Until now, we have:  

- identified the differences between anecdotal and empirical evidence    
- discussed the differences between observational and experimental studies 
- defined the terms _population_ and _sample_
- examined different types of (non)random sampling   

::: fragment
And OF COURSE
:::

- We took our first steps in RStudio!

:::


## 
### What about Today?

Today we will:

- have an introduction to descriptive statistics  
  - the principles of data visualization (_will continue next week with R_)   
  - see examples of frequency distributions enabling us to summarize __a categorical variable__ or __a quantitative variable__ 
    - either as a table or a graph  
- see how to identify/compute shape, center, and _(maybe tomorrow)_ dispersion of a quantitative variable.


## 
### Making Sense of Data

<br>

Data sets can be messy and overwhelming at first glance. By using descriptive statistics, we can:

- Visualize to reveal patterns,  
- Summarize key information, and   
- Organize data for better understanding.  


# Data Visualization

## Introduction
<br>

- One way of representing data (graphical)

  - Other ways are data sonification and data in tactile format.

- Infographics, charts, plots and even maps are examples of visualizing data.  
  - In this class, we will use the coordinate system, different colors, and shapes to visualize data.

- They can tell a story or help explain/explore data.


##
### A Successful Data Visualization...

According to [Royal Statistical Society](https://royal-statistical-society.github.io/datavisguide/docs/why-visualise.html), a successful data visualization will:

- Grab attention   
- Improve access to information   
- Increase precision   
- Bolster credibility   
- Summarise content

# Frequency Distributions

## Introduction


- A __frequency distribution__ is a representation of the frequency, indicating how often each value appears in a data set. 
- This information can be conveyed through tables or, more visually, using a graph.


# Summarizing A Categorical Variable

## A Frequency Distribution Table 

In this section, you will see two examples for summarizing a single categorical variable.

<br>

::: fragment
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: true
#| warning: false
library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
data(babies)


babies$smoke_logical <- as.logical(babies$smoke)

frequency_distribution <- table(babies$smoke_logical)

frequency_distribution_df <- as.data.frame(frequency_distribution)

frequency_distribution_df <- rename(frequency_distribution_df, Smoking_Status = Var1, Frequency = Freq)

total_row <- data.frame(Smoking_Status = "Total", Frequency = sum(frequency_distribution_df$Frequency))
frequency_distribution_df <- rbind(frequency_distribution_df, total_row)

kable(frequency_distribution_df, caption = "Frequency Distribution of Smoking Status")

```

:::


## Bar Chart 

A visual representation of categorical data showing the number of observations in each category.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: true
#| warning: false
babies <- babies %>% 
  mutate(smoke = as.logical(smoke))
ggplot(data = na.omit(babies), 
       aes(x = smoke)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Another Example

```{r}
set.seed(156465454)

likert_data <- data.frame(
  participant_id = 1:100,
  likert_response = sample(1:5, 100, replace = TRUE)
)

likert_data$likert_response_text <- factor(likert_data$likert_response, levels = 1:5, labels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly Agree"))

likert_frequency <- table(likert_data$likert_response_text)
likert_frequency_df <- as.data.frame(likert_frequency)
likert_frequency_df <- rename(likert_frequency_df, Likert_Response = Var1, Frequency = Freq)
total_row <- data.frame(Likert_Response = "Total", Frequency = sum(likert_frequency_df$Frequency))
likert_frequency_df <- rbind(likert_frequency_df, total_row)
kable(likert_frequency_df, caption = "Climate change affects the quality of human life")

```

## 

::: {.panel-tabset group="binwidth" style="font-size: 80%"}

## Ordered (?)

```{r}
# Create a bar chart
barplot(likert_frequency, main = "Climate change affects the quality of human life", xlab = "Likert Response", ylab = "Frequency", col = "maroon")
```

## Ordered

```{r}
barplot(likert_frequency[order(likert_frequency, decreasing = TRUE)], 
        main = "Climate change affects the quality of human life", 
        xlab = "Likert Response", 
        ylab = "Frequency", 
        col = "maroon")
```

# Summarizing A Quantitative Variable 

## Grouped Frequency Distributions

![](img/grouped.png)


## Histogram 
::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

- A visual summary of a quantitative variable.  
  - The x-axis represents the range of values divided into bins,  
  - The y-axis represents the count of data points in each bin.

- Histograms help identify shape of the distribution, outliers, central tendency, and variability.


- **No Gaps between Bars:** Unlike a bar chart, there are no gaps between the bars in a histogram because the bins are continuous.

# Shapes of Distributions

## A Quick Snapshot
![](img/shapes-of-distributions.png)


## Shapes of Distributions

The shape of a distribution can be represented by a smooth curve approximating of the histogram.

::: fragment
```{r}
#| echo: false
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(43)

# 1. Population Distribution (e.g., Normal Distribution)
population_1 <- rnorm(10000, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Smooth curve added to the histogram
hist(population_1, main = "An example of a symmetric, bell shaped distribution", xlab = "Value", col = "lightblue", border = "black", probability = TRUE)
lines(density(population_1), col = "red", lwd = 2)


```

# Central Tendency


## Measures of Center

To understand the __center__ or __typical value__ of a data set, we calculate

- Mean
- Median
- Mode

::: fragment
We also call these as __"Central Tendency"__
:::


## Mean
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- You might be familiar with this term. It is also known as 
  - arithmetic mean OR sample mean

::: fragment
::: callout-tip
We employed a symbolic convention to differentiate between a __variable__ and an __observed value__ of that variable.

  - $Y = birthweight$ (__Variable__)
  - $y = 12.8$ lb (__Observed Value__)

We now denote

- the observations in a sample by $y_1$, $y_2$, . . . , $y_n$
- the mean of the sample by the symbol $\bar{y}$  (read “y-bar”).
:::
:::
:::


## Mean

We calculate the mean by using this formula

![](img/mean-formula.png){fig-align="center"}



## Median

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- Imagine what would happen if Bill Gates was in our class and we calculated the average money in our bank account.
  - It might not be the best idea to interpret this average.
- Instead, we can calculate _median_ which is a value that splits the __ordered data__ into two equal parts. 

:::
::: fragment
#### How to Find the Median
:::

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- Arrange the observations in increasing order. 
- In the array of ordered observations, the median is
  -  the middle value __(if n is odd)__ or 
  - midway between the two middle values __(if n is even)__. 
- We denote the median of the sample by the symbol $\tilde{y}$ (read “y-tilde”).

:::

## Mode

- The mode in a dataset is the number that occurs with the highest frequency. 
- It serves as a measure of central tendency, indicating the most prevalent choice or the characteristic that appears most frequently in your sample.

## Let's have another toy example

- Assume that we have a following dataset:
  - 22, 6, 6, 4, 2

::: fragment

| Measures of Center  | Data and Calculation| Result  |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| Mean                | (2+4+6+6+22)/5      | 8       |
| Median              | 2,4,__6__,6,22      | 6       |
| Mode                | 2,4,__6__,__6__,22  | 6       |

### Understanding Mean and Median

- Let's see [Rossman & Chance Applet](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/descstats/Dotplot.htm) to visualize _mean_ and _median_. 


## Spread of Distributions
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
Let’s assume we managed to collect data from our squirrels on campus :) Our class was divided into three groups, and each group measured the weights (lbs) of 10 squirrels. Here are the results:

__Group 1:__ 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25 

__Group 2:__ 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5

__Group 3:__ 1.0, 1.4, 1.2, 1.4, 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, 1.0, 1.2, 1.3

Dr. Demirci mentioned that looking at these numbers is so confusing. Can you please calculate the sample mean for them to summarize this data?

::: fragment
All these groups calculated the same mean, which is 1.25 lbs. Dr. Demirci seemed not so happy with this number.
